This has a website buried one folder deeper and here are some thoughts for things TODO. 

# TODO

* Blog Pages

Formatting 
- Sidebar
- Icon
- Header
- Pagination? How and over what, do I need subcategories.
- Links, which ones and where
- Rules for Events and signing up
- Footer
- Pictures how to remove metadata before adding to blog entry
- Overall leader board (is it worth it? how would that even work?)
- Light Dark theme worked out
- Bootstrap (look into for individual pieces of page)

Events
- Players into subgroups
- Anyway to separate out Thursday games into sub lists for games over the weekends
- Game Day announcements, how would those differ
- Knight's roles
	- Organizer
	- Host
	- Player
	- Rules Knight (A role for a knight that will teach the proposed game)
- Possible to have two smaller games on a list for a single game night.  This is where the Rules knight role would come in handy.
